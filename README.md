# Audi Concept Lab on Orchestration


## Ideas Circuit
__10:50a - 4:30p__


### Objective
To brainstorm a wide variety of ideas for orchestration in the car, test and prioritize those ideas, and then illustrate and begin to design their key elements in narrative form.


### Teams

Participants will be broken down into 5 teams for each workshop, switching after the first two workshops and remaining in the same team for the final two.



### Order

1.	Experience Brainstorm on Whiteboards (with Dan; drawing exercise with Alison)
2.	Interface Brainstorm on the Car
3.	Investment Game
4.	Storyboarding



### Details

#### 1 Experience Brainstorm on Whiteboards
__10:50a - 12:00p__

##### Leader
Dan Goodwin with drawing exercise led by Alison Wong

##### Setup
Kickoff inspiration deck in the classroom, then move to the corner of whiteboards with participants at tables in groups.

##### Assets
*	Sharpies
*	Postits (multi colored, the 3”x5” are slightly preferable)

##### Description
Start from the feelings we are trying to elicit from the consumer and imagine the corresponding experiences. 

1.	Short 1 minute schpiel prefacing the experience, and share brainstorming principles (deferring judgement, one converation at a time, go for quantity, etc.)
2.	Explain the importance of the postit and being visual (cue Allison)
3.	Quick warmup and drawing exercise. Get people moving and playing with each other It is of the utmost importance that people feel free of judgment, comfortable 
4.	Share inspiration content of great moments of orchestration, extreme cases of customer service, beautiful multisensory experience
5.	Brainstorm aspirational experiences. These are not necessarily car related - it could be something like "everyday I want to feel _______" 
6.	Cluster the aspirations into a few different topics, then break into teams to brainstorm car experiences around specific experience types. Something like "how might we create the ultimate car experience that makes the person feel _____" Team size of 3-5.
7.	Each team has about 10-15 minutes to go as wide as possible. 
8.	Each team then presents a few of their favorite ideas, and the listening crowd is given a few minutes to build on the ideas

##### Input
Inspiration deck and brainstorm questions

##### Output
Wall of ideas on post-it notes in category buckets

##### Prizes
*	best idea
*	most ideas
*	least feasible idea

##### Presentation
*	One person from each team will present ideas
*	Dan will present the ideas behind the buckets and re-state each of the top ideas?

##### Documentation
*	Handheld throughout the process (including inspiration presentation and drawing exercise)
*	GoPro headcam by participant during the brainstorming process
*	Handheld of presentations





#### 2 Interface Brainstorm on the Car
__12:00 - 1:00p__

##### Leader
Alex Kauffmann

##### Setup
5 teams at separate segments of the large circular table

##### Assets
*	Tabloid-sized printouts of sections of the car
*	black and color sharpies and pencils for drawing on the printed sections
*	chalk pens, stickers and tape for annotating the physical car

##### Description
Use the existing car interface as stimulus for a "what if" exercise that asks the participants to reconsider the parts of the car everyone assumes are immutable. What if the steering wheel weren't for steering? What if the pedals weren't for braking and accelerating? Gearshift? Console? Glovebox? Mirrors? Then we could take these over and give them new functions that might then be prototyped the next day.

##### Input
Knowledge of the aspirational experiences developed in Dan's brainstorm

##### Output
1.	Annotated inventory and timing diagrams of relationships between elements of the car that illustrate new orchestrated experiences on printed sections of the car (pinned up on the whiteboards)
2.	Annotated diagrams on the car showing the modifications that would need to be made to implement each idea

##### Prizes
*	experience that incorporates the largest inventory
*	idea that bastardizes an element of the car the most
*	idea that beats Minority Report

##### Presentation
One person from each team will pinup the teams best 3-5 ideas on the whiteboards and talk through their idea.

##### Documentation
*	General team working shots with handhelds and boom mic
*	Handhelds capturing presentations with boom mic
*	Follow someone putting diagrams in the car
*	Go Pro headcam of someone putting diagrams in the car
*	Drone flyover of teams working at tables and on the car




-------------------------------------------------
#### Working Lunch


##### Team Formation
__1:00 - 1:10p__

Teams will give themselves a team name and agenda based on the desires of the people on the team. They will strategize for the draft.


##### Ideas Draft
__1:10 - 1:20p__

Teams will draw for draft positions. Chris and Troy will lead teams through chosing idea fragments from the whiteboards (from postits and car section drawings). We will draw until each team has as many ideas as they want.


##### Lunch
__1:20 - 2:10p__

Over lunch, teams will assemble their idea fragments into orchestrated experiences, filling out Brad's game cards.

-------------------------------------------------





#### 3 Investment Game
__2:15 - 3:15p__

##### Leader
Brad Simpson

##### Setup
???

##### Supplies Needed
*	map tacks/pins
*	experience pitch cards
*	play money
*	game board (large, mounted)

##### Description
Take experiences or hero moments that they brainstorm and list some 'capabilities' that Audi would have to develop or grow in order to achieve the experience. For example, say a group brainstorms an experience focused around a 3D holographic heads-up display. They would have to develop some capabilities around 1) Interface & Interaction 2) Display Technologies and 3) Sensor Technologies. So on so forth for each experience.

##### Inputs
Filled out experience pitch cards for 4 ideas

##### Outputs
Prune down, combine, edit, and expand existing ideas into X ideas ??

##### Prizes
*	winner
*	best job of managing a bad hand
*	most potential but underwhelming

##### Presentation
?? (Prize for the winners?)






#### 4 Storyboarding
__3:15 - 4:15p__

##### Leader
Alison Wong

##### Setup
5 Teams sat at the segments of the zig-zag table

##### Supplies Needed
*	preprinted tabloid drawing template sheets with three panels on each
*	preprinted concept sheets to describe the ideas 

##### Description
Alison will give an introduction to storyboarding and then coach each team through developing a cohesive story that stitches together each of their remaining ideas into a single narrative.  From discussing these ideas, the team will figure out which ideas they want to keep and build into the strongest narrative.  Some may fall away because of their relevance.  We will hand out pre-printed sheets with panels on them where they can describe the narrative.  Also, separately, we have worksheets for each idea which allows them to elaborate on the pros/cons/considerations/constraints, etc.


##### Inputs
Pitch cards from Brad's game and an understanding of an investment strategy 

##### Outputs
Storyboard drawings for a narrative combining X (how many?) ideas

##### Prizes
*	most beautiful drawing
*	most compelling interface
*	most indecipherable drawing

##### Presentations
*	one member of each team will present the narrative at the whiteboards



-------------------------------------------------
#### Storytelling Challenge
__4:15 - 4:30p__

Who can weave the most compelling narrative through the most ideas?

Prize for the winner.
-------------------------------------------------



### Pruning and Assigning
__4:30 - 5:45p__

##### Leader
Chris and Troy

##### Description
All of the ideas in different forms - postits, diagrams, storyboard drawings - will be posted on the whiteboards. We will then go through as a group to figure out who would like to work on what and how.




## Outstanding Questions
*	setup for Brad's game (at tables? standalone chairs? what is the flow like between making moves?)
*	how many ideas should go into Alison's workshop?
*	will Alison's workshop get teams to synthesize into a single narrative, or still smaller narrative fragments?
*	can it be competitive throughout? Can each workshop have a goal?
